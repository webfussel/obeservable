# obeservable
## General
Different observable and - contrary to the name - lightweight objects.
To be fair, in the end it's something everyone could do with a bit of time, but why reinvent the wheel?

How often did you need an Eventbus and created it from scratch again and again?  
How often did you need an Observable Array or HashMap and recreated them once again?

**Never?** Fair enough. But if you need those - check out this package.

## Why "obeseverable"?
It was a typo that I realized too late and I just went with it and created that terrible joke in the description.
